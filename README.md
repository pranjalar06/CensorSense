# 🎬 CensorSense – Personalized Content Filtering Tool

With the reign of OTT platforms, we are forced into one-size-fits-all content.  
**CensorSense** is here to change that.

It’s a browser-based tool (like a Chrome Extension) that lets you define what kind of content you want to skip—whether it's profanity, nudity, violence, or disturbing visuals.  
CensorSense empowers users by letting them enjoy content **while staying in their comfort zone**.

## 💡 Idea

CensorSense is built for anyone who's ever:

- Skipped a scene during family movie night because it was too awkward
- Struggled with emotional triggers in otherwise great content
- Wanted to watch a show *without* disturbing visuals or explicit language

Instead of blanket censorship, CensorSense offers customizable filters.  
Blur, mute, replace, or skip scenes using AI-based content detection.

## 🧪 MVP Feature

The **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** includes:

**Scene Summary Mode** –  
CensorSense doesn’t just skip or mute—it also gives a **brief, non-graphic summary** of what was skipped or blurred, so users stay in the loop without being exposed to uncomfortable content.
